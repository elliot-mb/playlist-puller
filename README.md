# Playlist puller
After authenticating your Spotify and YouTube accounts, this script makes calls to both APIs to automatically copy playlists from Spotify to YouTube.
Each song title and artist of a selected Spotify playlist are searched (quota-cost free using the [Invidious API](https://docs.invidious.io/api/#get-apiv1videosid)), the most relevant result is then added to a newly-made YouTube playlist.
